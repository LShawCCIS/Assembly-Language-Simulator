# Assembly-Language-Simulator
The project showcased here is a simple simulator for programming in Assembly language (written in C++).

The idea of this project is to simulate writing in Assembly language in C++. This program allows you to either write code in its bash, or allows you to create/load a file with assembly code and run it. 

The stack pointer is not yet implemented.
